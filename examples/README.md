A series of notebooks to demonstrate some common workflows using DTBase. Note, these notebooks aren't necessarily designed to be run, but rather as documentation where images and code can live happily together.

If the user does want to interact with the notebooks, then they need to install jupyter notebooks:

`pip install jupyter notebook`
